# Orlando Tech

This is the website for [Orlando Tech](http://orlandote.ch). If you want to do something awesome - Do it! i.e. Add your local group or meetup to our [Groups List](http://orlandote.ch/groups) or your startup/product to the [Built In](http://orlandote.ch) list!


## Hey, I want to add my Company to the list!
TLDR, Submit a [Pull Request](http://github.com/orlandotech/orlandotech.github.io/pulls).

So, maybe you saw the list we're trying to keep of the incredibe tech companies coming out of The City Beautiful. And maybe you were all like, hey!! I want to get my startup/product/thing on that list! Well, enough said friend.

#### For those not familiar with Git / GitHub
Before you do anything else, take the wonderful [Try Git](http://try.github.com) course from Orlando's very own [Code School](http://codeschool.com). This gives you an awesome primer on using Git. Then, read [this](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and if you still have some questions - Submit an Issue or holla at us [@orlndotech](http://twitter.com/orlndotech).

#### Important notes about this site.
This website is being served via [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) and is organized as a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blog. It's also got components being managed through [Bower](http://bower.io). It's a good idea to read up on how each of those tools work before playing around with this site.
